## Project Overview
This project presents a **comparative evaluation** of three deep learning models: **CNN**, **CNN-LSTM**, and **MiniVGG** for the task of **network traffic classification**. The models are evaluated on their performance using different datasets and augmented with **data augmentation techniques** to improve their generalization. The models are assessed on key performance metrics, including **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**. Additionally, **LIME** and **SHAP** are applied to **CNN-LSTM** for model explainability.

---

## Datasets Used
The models were trained and evaluated using two distinct datasets:
1. **USTC-TFC Dataset**: A publicly available dataset for traffic classification.
2. **VPN Dataset**: Network traffic data specifically focusing on VPN traffic, providing a good variety of patterns for classification tasks.

## Models Overview
### CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
The **CNN** model is a standard deep learning architecture known for its ability to detect patterns in data through convolutional layers. It is commonly used for tasks like image recognition and classification but is also effective for network traffic classification when the data is formatted into grid-like structures.

### CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory)
The **CNN-LSTM** model combines the power of convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction with LSTM layers for sequential data processing. This hybrid approach is particularly useful for network traffic data that has inherent sequential dependencies, such as packet flows in communication networks.

### MiniVGG
The **MiniVGG** model is a lightweight version of the **VGG** architecture, providing a simpler but effective approach for classification tasks. It consists of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers, designed to be computationally efficient while retaining good performance.

## Data Augmentation Techniques
Data augmentation is an essential step to improve model performance by introducing variations in the data, preventing overfitting, and improving generalization. The following augmentation techniques were applied to the datasets:
- **Average Augmentation**: Gaussian noise is added to the original data to simulate minor variations and perturbations in the traffic data.
- **MTU Augmentation**: Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) augmentation simulates packet fragmentation to create a more realistic representation of network traffic.
- **Without Augmentation**: This is the baseline setup, where the model is trained on the raw dataset without any data modifications.

---

## Model Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics were used to evaluate the performance of each model across different augmentation strategies:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive results among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positive results among all actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of model performance.
- **LIME and SHAP**: Model explainability methods applied to CNN-LSTM to understand how the model makes predictions.
